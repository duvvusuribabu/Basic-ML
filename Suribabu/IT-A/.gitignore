program to find the largest number among the three input numbers

In [5]:
num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))
num3 = float(input("Enter third number: "))

if (num1 >= num2) and (num1 >= num3):
   largest = num1
elif (num2 >= num1) and (num2 >= num3):
   largest = num2
else:
   largest = num3

print("The largest number is", largest)
Enter first number: 23
Enter second number: 35
Enter third number: 46
The largest number is 46.0







program to check if a number is prime or not

   # check for factors
   for i in range(2,num):
       if (num % i) == 0:
           print(num,"is not a prime number")
           print(i,"times",num//i,"is",num)
           break
   else:
       print(num,"is a prime number")

Python program to find the factorial of a number

In [6]:
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

factorial = 1

# check if the number is negative, positive or zero
if num < 0:
   print("Sorry, factorial does not exist for negative numbers")
elif num == 0:
   print("The factorial of 0 is 1")
else:
   for i in range(1,num + 1):
       factorial = factorial*i
   print("The factorial of",num,"is",factorial)
Enter a number: 4
The factorial of 4 is 24
